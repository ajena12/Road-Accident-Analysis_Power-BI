Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
This project is all about understanding patterns in road accidents using Power BI. I worked with a dataset that included accident details like date, time, junction control, weather conditions, and more â€” and turned it into meaningful insights through interactive dashboards.

Whatâ€™s Inside? 
1. Dashboard 1 (Overview): Gives a quick summary of when and where accidents are happening the most.
2. Dashboard 2 (Trends & Analysis): Dives deeper into factors like accident severity, road surface conditions, and junction types.
3. Road Accident Report: A combined PDF with final insights and visualizations.

What I Explored?
1. Which days and times see the most accidents
2. How road types and junction controls affect accident frequency
3. The role of weather and road conditions in accident severity
4. Trends in accident severity levels over time
